step:1 make it type module in package.json and write a start script to run the nodemon server

<!-- gota tell our nodemon to watch our index.js -->

lets have our port in .env

to use .env we need to use dotenv

lets first creat an api point

<!-- ok our server ecperience a cors error so lets add corse in our backend -->

<!-- we also need body-parser to parse data -->

step 2 now its time to connect to our mongo db

so its connected now lets build a Studnet schema its pretty easy

Thats it for adding the student first digest it than move to next vedio

<!-- great if you already have build everything uptil now the rest will be easy -->

step 3 getting all data from data base leme tell you how
lets explore model.find and model.findOne in our case we have student as model
